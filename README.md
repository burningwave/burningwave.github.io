Welcome to Burningwave, a set consisting of a [library for building Java frameworks](https://burningwave.github.io/core/) and other applications and frameworks based on it.

<br/>

The projects of Burningwave are:
* [**JVM Driver**](https://burningwave.github.io/jvm-driver/): a driver to allow deep interaction with the JVM without any restrictions
* [**Core**](https://burningwave.github.io/core/): an advanced, free and open source Java frameworks building library
* [**Tools**](https://burningwave.github.io/tools/): a set of components based on [Core](https://burningwave.github.io/core/) library that have high-level functionality
* [**Graph**](https://burningwave.github.io/graph/): a framework based on [Core](https://burningwave.github.io/core/) library for creating graphs of synchronous/asynchronous Java method calls using a JSon configuration
* [**Miscellaneous Services**](https://burningwave.github.io/miscellaneous-services/) a simple application with which is possible to retrieve some statistical data

With Burningwave's software you can:
* [create your own dependency injection framework in Java](https://dev.to/bw_software/how-to-create-your-own-dependency-injection-framework-o2l)
* [making applications created with old Java versions work on Java 9 and later versions](https://dev.to/bw_software/making-applications-created-with-old-java-versions-work-on-java-9-and-later-versions-19ld)
* [generate classes at runtime and invoke their methods with and without the use of Reflection](https://dev.to/bw_software/generating-classes-at-runtime-and-invoking-their-methods-with-and-without-the-use-of-reflection-in-java-41e3)
* [search classes by every criteria that your imagination can make](https://dev.to/bw_software/how-to-scan-the-classpath-in-java-fk8)
* [do much more](https://dev.to/bw_software/series/10197)
